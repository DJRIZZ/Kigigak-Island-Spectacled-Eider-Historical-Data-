readme_kig_historical_data

Data from the Kigigak Island Spectacled Eider monitoring project collected between 1992 and 2015.

Biologists with the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge collected these data, which were transferred to the Endangered Species Recovery Program when Endangered Species took over Spectacled Eider monitoring in 2019.
